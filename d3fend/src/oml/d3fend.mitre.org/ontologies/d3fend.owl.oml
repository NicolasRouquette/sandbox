	This can be accomplished by verifying the digital signature on certificate.
	
	### Certificate path analysis
	The client's browser can perform path verification to ensure that the server's certificate contains a valid trust anchor.
	
	### Certificate configuration analysis
	Some browsers can be configured to implement the key-usage extensions contained certificates. This can help to prevent a certificate from being misused.
	
	### Certificate revocation status analysis
	Using either Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to determine the revocation status. OCSP Stapling, binding the status with the certificate, helps to mitigate potential delay in status verifications.
	
	## Considerations
	* Management of the PKI across the enterprise typically requires automation to maintain scalability and flexibility
	* If the certificate authority, issuing the certificate, is compromised then all of the certificates issued by the CA are suspect
	* There may be delays associated with updates to certificates
	* Revoked certificates give the appearance of valid certificates until they are published to a trusted revocation service (OCSP or CRL)

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Traditional supervised learning often requires a large number of labeled instances, which can be costly or time-consuming to obtain. Active learning addresses this labeling bottleneck by asking an oracle (e.g., a human annotator) to label selected unlabeled instances. The goal is to achieve high accuracy with minimal labeling effort.
	
	## Considerations
	Active learning is particularly useful in scenarios where data is abundant but labeled instances are scarce or expensive. Examples include speech recognition, information extraction, and document classification.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	Active logical link mapping establishes awareness of logical links in the network by sending data over the network to gather information about logical connections in the network.
	
	Typically this will be achieved through network telemetry coordinated for network management and monitoring and will use a link layer discovery protocol such as LLDP and the information gathered and aggregated a higher levels using an application protocol such as SNMP.  The information may be polled by network management softare or configured once and then pushed from network sensors (or agents.)
	
	Another means of establishing network connectivity is by means of sendingn traffic through the use of a tool such as traceroute, to determine the logical paths through the network architecture.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* Best practice is to encrypte network monitoring data and require authentication for queries or admin/management functions.
	* Push notifications reduce bandwidth necessary to capture and maintain information if reliable transport is used.
	* Special consideration should be made before using of active scanning in OT networks and OT-safe options chosen where available.'''

	@definition "Agglomerative Clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering method where data points are grouped together based on similarity. Initially, each data point is treated as an individual cluster, and then in successive iterations, the closest clusters are merged until only one large cluster remains or until a specified stopping criterion is met."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster. The algorithm then iterates, identifying the two clusters that are closest to each other based on a defined distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan). These two clusters are then merged into a single cluster. This process continues iteratively, merging the closest pairs of clusters in each step until all data points are merged into a single cluster or until other stopping criteria are achieved. A dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram, can be used to represent the sequence of merges, providing a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of data.
	
	## Considerations
	
	- **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
	
	- **Scalability**: Agglomerative clustering can be computationally intensive for large datasets.
	
	- **Sensitivity**: The method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.
	
	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Unsupervised Learning**:
	
	- **Number of Clusters**: Determine an optimal number of clusters using the dendrogram and techniques like the elbow method.
	
	- **Cluster Analysis**:
	
	- **Silhouette Score**: Evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
	
	- **Dunn Index**: Measures the ratio between the smallest distance between observations not in the same cluster to the largest intra-cluster distance.
	
	- **Hierarchical Clustering**:
	
	- **Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the correlation between the distances of points in feature space and their distances on the dendrogram. Helps assess the fidelity of the dendrogram in preserving pairwise distances between samples.
	
	- **Agglomerative Clustering**:
	
	- **Linkage Criteria**: Test different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average) to determine which produces the most cohesive clusters for the data at hand.
	
	## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries

	- A versatile machine learning library in Python.

	Given two competing hypotheses and some relevant data, Bayesian hypothesis testing begins by specifying separate prior distributions to quantitatively describe each hypothesis. The combination of the likelihood function for the observed data with each of the prior distributions yields hypothesis-specific models. For each of the hypothesis-specific models, averaging (ie, integrating) the likelihood with respect to the prior distribution across the entire parameter space yields the probability of the data under the model and, therefore, the corresponding hypothesis. This quantity is more commonly referred to as the marginal likelihood and represents the average fit of the model to the data. The ratio of the marginal likelihoods for both hypothesis-specific models is known as the Bayes factor.

	@definition "Boosting is a sequential process where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model"
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Boosting consists of using sequentially weak learners where each iteration’s training focuses on previously misclassified instances in order to improve on the previous iteration. This process is continued iteratively until the final prediction is made by aggregating the previous predictions.
	
	## Considerations
	Boosting can be computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and slower to train compared to other ensemble methods.
	
	There are three main types of Boosting algorithms
	- Adaptive Boosting
	Adaptive Boosting (sometimes called AdaBoost) works by adding equal importance to each piece of a dataset and running it through the base learning algorithms. Every algorithm that errors, the boosting algorithm assigns a higher importance to. This continues until an acceptable level of confidence is reached.
	- Gradient Boosting
	Gradient Boosting starts by training multiple models simultaneously to gather a strong estimate of strength to build new base learning algorithms.
	- XGBoosting
	XGBoosting is a scalable tree boosting model. Using decision trees, weight is assigned to each variable and put into a decision tree. Outputs that are classified by the algorithm as wrong or weak are put into a second decision tree and the results form a stronger model.

	Bytes are analyzed as if they are machine code instructions, and such instructions that are a common component of known shellcode are noted, such as stack pivots, reads from a Memory Address Table, and system calls for functions that disable protections or execute code.  For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.

	If the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.
	
	## Considerations
	
	### False Negatives
	If the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.
	
	Due to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.
	
	This technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.
	
	This technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.
	
	This technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.
	
	With inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.
	
	### False Positives
	
	Byte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.'''

	@definition "Persisting either a server's X.509 certificate or their public key and comparing that to server's presented identity to allow for greater client confidence in the remote server's identity for SSL connections."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Pinning allows for a trusted copy of a certificate or public key to be associated with a server and thus reducing the likelihood of frequently visited sites being subjected to man-in-the-middle attacks. Certificates or public keys can be pinned after a trusted connection has been established or the pinning can be preloaded in an application, which is the preferred method for mobile applications.
	
	Pinning can take the form of certificate pinning or public key pinning.
	
	## Forms of Pinning
	* Certificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X.509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.
	
	* Public Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X.509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.
	
	An extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated
	* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently
	* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.
	* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers. They now favor certificate analysis via public certificate transparency logs, and the EXPECT-CT HTTP header.'''

	@definition "Classification uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Classification recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.
	
	## Considerations:
	
	There are many different types of classification algorithms for modeling classification predictive modeling problems.
	
	There is no single theory on how to map algorithms onto problem types; instead, it is generally recommended that a practitioner use controlled experiments and discover which algorithm and algorithm configuration results in the best performance for a given classification task.
	
	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Machine Learning**:
	
	- **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is
	free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,
	outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality
	is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and
	systems with the desired performance.
	
	- **Verify development datasets are representative** of expected
	operational environment and data collection means.  Compare
	distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory
	data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training
	data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data
	must be drawn from a representative dataset.)
	
	- **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so
	that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**
	
	- **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain
	SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model
	may underperform and suggest refinements.
	
	- **Classification**:
	
	- **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of
	the following may be necessary, but should be considered for
	both verification (developmental test) and operational test
	stages use:
	
	- **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.
	
	- **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.
	
	- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.
	
	- **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single
	score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
	
	- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve
	shows the performance of a classification model at all
	classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate
	over the False Positive Rate.
	
	- **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the
	two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is
	scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.
	
	- **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,
	the performance at points
	
	- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that
	allows the visualization of the performance of an
	algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in
	an actual class while each column represents the instances in
	a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of
	contingency table, with two dimensions ("actual" and
	"predicted"), and identical sets of "classes" in both
	dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a
	variable in the contingency table.)
	
	- **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the
	predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data
	set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the
	classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:
	
	- **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the
	collection method may have an underlying bias.
	
	- **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can
	introduce bias.
	
	- **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model
	parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.
	
	- **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting
	model and too simple.
	
	- **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly
	correlated.
	
	- **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the
	model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular
	set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data
	reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that
	contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.
	Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture
	the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will
	underfit a non-linear dataset.
	
	## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries:
	
	- **Python**:
	
	- **scikit-learn**: Is a free software machine learning library for
	Python and includes features for classification.
	
	- **TensorFlow**: is an end-to-end source machine learning
	platform.
	
	- **Keras**: is an open-source library that provides a Python API
	designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.
	
	- **PyTorch**: Is a machine learning framework based on the Torch
	library.
	
	- **R**:
	
	- **caret**: Classification And REgression Training package contains
	functions to streamline model training for complex regression
	and classification problems.
	
	- **randomForest**: Implementation of classification and regression
	based on forest of trees.

	### Monitoring traffic to unallocated IP space
	One approach looks for failed connection attempts against unallocated IP space. First, network traffic is captured to map out the network to identify network assets as well as unallocated IP space. The map is then used to determine if connection attempts are being made to the unallocated IP space.
	
	### Monitoring for sequentially transmitted traffic
	Another approach passively inspects network traffic with application protocol analyzers observing network activity characteristics such as volume of packets sent/ received, TCP session attributes, and connection information between hosts (start time, source/destination host, services, etc.). Then using pattern matching to identify traffic which appears to be probing for network hosts.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* Implementations that rely on analysis of unallocated IP address space increase in their complexity with network size and decentralized network infrastructure.
	* Inventory of unallocated IP space should should be continuously updated to mitigate the risk of false positives.
	* IPv6 also introduces challenges including IPv6 traffic bypassing IPv4 specific protection systems (ex. firewalls and IDS) and complexity in managing both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.'''

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	Container images are standalone collections of the executable code and
	content that are used to populate a container environment.
	They are usually created by either building a container from scratch or by
	building on top of an existing image pulled from a repository.
	
	Throughout the container build workflow,
	images should be scanned to identify:
	
	- outdated libraries,
	- known vulnerabilities,
	- or misconfigurations, such as insecure ports or permissions.
	
	Scanning should also provide the flexibility to disregard false positives
	for vulnerability detection where knowledgeable
	cybersecurity professionals have deemed alerts to be inaccurate.
	
	One approach to implementing image scanning is to use an admission controller
	to block deployments if the image does not comply with the organization's
	security policies.
	
	An admission controller is a Container Orchestration feature that can intercept and
	process requests to the Container Orchestration API prior to persistence of the object,
	but after the request is authenticated and authorized.
	A webhook can be implemented to scan any image before it is deployed in the orchestrator.
	This admission controller
	
	## Considerations
	
	* Image scanning is key to ensuring deployed containers are secure.
	* Using trusted repositories to build containers is a critical part of the container build workflow.
	* This technique does not necessarly prevent the build process to add insecure or unsecured
	files to the Image.

	#### Memory
	Credentials may be stored in memory for a variety of reasons; on Windows, they may be stored in lsass.exe.  Once a credential dumper like mimikatz runs and dumps the memory of lsass.exe, the credentials of every account logged on since boot are potentially compromised.
	When such an event occurs, this analytic will give the forensic context to identify compromised users. Those users could potentially be used in later events for additional logons.
	
	
	#### Hard disk
	Operating System may cache a certain number of credentials onto the hard disk to use as a source of truth if it cannot contact the credential server.  In many versions of Microsoft Windows, the 10 most recent are cached by default; this setting can be changed in the Microsoft Management Console's Local Security Policy: ```Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Local Policy -> Security Options -> Interactive Logon: Number of previous logons to cache -> 0```  Here we are not concerned with the alteration of the credentials but the fact that they might be read.  If the attacker has physical access to the machine they are unlikely to be stopped from reading files on the filesystem.
	"In the event that the domain controller is unavailable Windows will check the last password hashes that has been cached in order to authenticate the user with the system. These password hashes are cached in the following registry setting:
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Cache
	Mimikatz can retrieve these hashes if the following command is executed:
	lsadump::cache" [1]
	
	The Registry Hive, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM, which is stored in the supporting files %systemroot%\System32\Config\{Sam,sam.log,sam.sav}, contains the SAM file.
	
	DC: This is stored in %systemroot%\ntds\ntds.dit. (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/blog/default.aspx?d=10/2017)
	
	Sometimes memory, which contains credentials, could get on the hard disk. Like with hiberfil.sys in Windows.  Equivalent on Linux
	
	
	In Linux, an attacker could read the /etc/shadow file.
	
	Reading from /proc directory: mimipenguin, many others.
	
	## Considerations
	Effective implementation requires identifying any location that could end up containing credentials, and detecting an method of potential access to a source of credential data.

	This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways.
	
	* One example analytic determines whether or not a domain name was generated with an algorithm. Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are sometimes used to create a domain name automatically  that will resolve to C2 infrastructure, without directly coding the domains in question into the malicious code.
	* Another method analyzes information about domains that have been visited, including whether a domain name is longer than a common length,  if a dynamic DNS domain was visited, if a fast-flux domain was visited, and if a recently created domain was visited. These factors are used to develop a score and if that score is over a certain threshold, an alert is generated.
	* Collected malware samples can be executed in a virtual environment to identify network domains that are connected to during execution. The network domains are then generated into signatures to identity bad domains for other hosts.
	
	This technique does not check for content hosted at the domain.

Dead code should be removed since this type of code can produce unexpected results, if accidentally or maliciously forced to execute.
	
	Dead code identification is typically performed by algorithms that implement program flows analysis looking for unreachable code. The dead code is eliminated by instructing compilers to remove the code through compiler flags, i.e., '-fdce' is used for Dead Code Elimination.

	@definition "Decision tree learning is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. In this formalism, a classification or regression decision tree is used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	A decision tree starts with a root node, which does not have any incoming branches. The outgoing branches from the root node then feed into the internal nodes, also known as decision nodes. Based on the available features, both node types conduct evaluations to form homogenous subsets, which are denoted by leaf nodes, or terminal nodes. The leaf nodes represent all the possible outcomes within the dataset.
	
	## Considerations
	
	While the basic underlying model is that of a decision tree, the decision tree node criteria, and the method for identifying splits varies significantly depending on the learning algorithm selected (e.g., CART, ID3, C4.5, C5.0, CHAID, MARS.)  Extensions like linear and logistic trees can add additional expressiveness as well.
	
	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Machine Learning**:
	
	- **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is
	free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,
	outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality
	is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and
	systems with the desired performance.
	
	- **Verify development datasets are representative**: of expected
	operational environment and data collection means.  Compare
	distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory
	data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training
	data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data
	must be drawn from a representative dataset.)
	
	- **Use a variety of data sets**: where available and applicable, to
	reflect different operating and environment conditions that are
	likley to be be encountered.
	
	- **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so
	that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**
	
	- **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain
	SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model
	may underperform and suggest refinements.
	
	- **Classification**:
	
	- **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of
	the following may be necessary, but should be considered for
	both verification (developmental test) and operational test
	stages use:
	
	- **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.
	
	- **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.
	
	- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.
	
	- **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single
	score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.
	
	- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve
	shows the performance of a classification model at all
	classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate
	over the False Positive Rate.
	
	- **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the
	two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is
	scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.
	
	- **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,
	the performance at points
	
	- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that
	allows the visualization of the performance of an
	algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in
	an actual class while each column represents the instances in
	a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of
	contingency table, with two dimensions ("actual" and
	"predicted"), and identical sets of "classes" in both
	dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a
	variable in the contingency table.)
	
	- **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the
	predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data
	set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the
	classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:
	
	- **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the
	collection method may have an underlying bias.
	
	- **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can
	introduce bias.
	
	- **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model
	parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.
	
	- **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting
	model and too simple.
	
	- **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly
	correlated.
	
	- **Supervised Learning**:
	
	- **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the
	model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular
	set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data
	reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that
	contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.
	Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture
	the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will
	underfit a non-linear dataset.
	
	- **Sensitivity**: Perform N-fold Cross validation to indicate how
	much sensitivity the algorithm has to data variation and to avoid
	overfitting operational models.
	
	- **Decision Tree Learning**:
	
	- **Sensitive to unbalanced classes**: Examine and determine target
	class balance; decision tree learning algorithms are especially
	sensitive to unbalanced target classes.
	
	- **Consider decision boundaries**: Perform exploratory data
	analysis to determine if decision boundaries lie alongaxes of
	features. _Decision trees are ideal when decision boundaries can
	be found that lie along axes of features._
	
	- **Decision tree overfitting** may require tuning algorithm hyperparameters such as tree depth, max features used, max leaf nodes, etc.
	
	- **Pruning** may result in a more robust model in real-word applications.
	
	- **Missing values**: Inspect the data set to determine if there
	are missing values and select a means to address them, either by
	choosing an algorithm that works well or a way to impute the
	value or eliminate the missing values in the data sensors or
	pipeline.
	
	## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries
	
	- **scikit-learn**: includes tree algorithms for ID3, C4.5, C5.0, and CART.
	
	- **Weka**: includes J48 (C4.5), SimpleCart (CART), Logistic Model Trees, Naive Bayes Trees, and more.
	
	### Validation Approach
	- Use operationally relevant data across the range of application's operating environment.
	- Incorporate some kind of continuous validation to address concept drift and the need to retrain the model and/or check data quality.

	The core reasoning problems for description logics (DLs) are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.
	
	DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as terminological knowledge). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	This technique can be accomplished in a number of ways:
	
	* A kernel level security agent installed on a host machine ensures that the driver associated with the agent is first in the initialization order. A dependent DLL associated with the driver is configured to be processed before other dependent DLLs and executes a number of operations to ensure the driver associated with the security agent is initialized first.
	
	* Kernel components can be signed by a certificate obtained by a third party to verify the source of the component and whether it has been modified. When signed, the component will include a signature block implemented as a hash value of the component header and can also include a certificate chain. The signature and certificate data are typically added before the kernel component is distributed to the public.
	
	
	## Considerations
	
	* The private keys to sign certificates as reputable companies have been stolen in the past -- in cases such as where certificates from Adobe, Realtek, and JMicron have been used to sign malicious executables. (Source: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-exploits-digital-certificates/#gref)
	
	* Trusted Root Certificate Authorities have been compromised, yielding the ability to use the compromised keys to generate certificates with an arbitrary company name.
	
	* It may not be difficult for an attacker to start an organization which can obtain a signed certificate.
	
	* A root certificate authority (CA) whose certificate is trusted in the verification logic could generate incorrect certificates, if they are lax or have ulterior motives.'''

	## Considerations
	* Malware often detects a fake environment, then changes its behavior accordingly. For example, it could detect that the system clock is being sped up in an effort to get it to execute commands that it would normally only execute at a later time, or that the hardware manufacturer of the machine is a virtualization provider.
	* Malware can attempt to determine if it is being debugged, and change its behavior accordingly.

	For email that needs to be removed, an infosec organization may choose to take additional follow-up actions (such as blocking the sources or notifying providers), rather than only relying on email deletion.
	
	For the case where users detect likely suspicious email files, the organization should consider implementing a means for reporting these emails to their infosec organization.

	@definition "Validates that a referenced exception handler pointer is a valid exception handler."
	@kb-article '''## How It Works
	When a process encounters an exception, it calls an exception handler to deal with the exception.  The method by which this exception handler is determined varies by the operating system.  The exception handler is called, even if it is the default exception handler to terminate the program and display a message that the program stopped working.  In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.
	
	In Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.
	
	The exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.
	
	A buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.
	
	With Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.
	
	### Runtime valid exception handler source generation
	The source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.
	
	### Compile-time
	The source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.
	
	## Considerations
	If the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.
	
	If the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.
	If an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.
	
	SafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.'''

The hash decrypted by the public key is compared to the new hash and if there is a mismatch, further techniques, such as file deletion, file quarantine, or **Executable Blacklisting** may be invoked.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	#### Criteria
	
	A policy-enforcing application can register an application for denylisting based on conditions including the following:
	
	* File attributes
	* file name
	* file path
	* file hash
	* file publisher, as obtained from the digital signature
	* permissions of the file
	* File malware scan (eg. Windows SmartScreen)
	* User-File combination
	
	This may be done to prevent execution of applications which are:
	
	* an old version with known vulnerabilities
	* without a valid license, which could cause legal issues
	* in a directory that is accessible to low-privileged users, that could be accessed by a malware dropper
	* known trojan horse programs
	* too open in their permissions, possibly set to run as a user other than the originator or allowing execution when they should not be
	* a match to the hash of other known malware
	* are detected as undesirable based on a file scan runtime behavior
	
	System administrators will customize the rules for the given environment.
	
	#### Backend
	
	The policy-enforcing program may work by running in kernel mode, and [intercepting] [system calls which execute a process].
	
	## Considerations
	
	* If denylisting is done by filename, filepath, or hash, these mechanisms may be a worthy first line of defense and detection, but could still be evaded by an attacker.
	* Continuous management is needed to keep the denylist up to date, whether it is based on hash, publisher, behavior, or any other digital artifact.
	* Although denylists based on attributes such as file path and virus scan could defend against some threats which they have not been explicitly coded to block, denylists may not provide protection from new, unknown, or zero day attacks.

	* The computational load for scanning, and
	* The resilience of the engine to deal with adversarial content presented in different forms-- content which in some cases is designed to exploit or defeat the scanning engines.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	Adversaries may place files or programs into a computer's file system to perform malicious actions. As part of the eviction process, these files and programs should be removed to prevent further compromise or reinfection. Examples of malicious types of files are malware which is directly harmful and content files with the intent to deceive users (e.g., phishing.)
	
	On Windows systems, antivirus (AV) software should be used to safely and permanently remove malicious files. AV software may first quarantine a suspected malicious file, which is the process of moving a file from its original location to a new location and makes changes so that it cannot be executed. Users can then verify that the file is not benign and then permanently delete it.
	
	## Considerations
	
	When it is determined that a file should be removed for security purposes, the organization--or systems implementing an organization's policies--may determine that the file should not simply be deleted from the enterprise's mission systems, but be quarantined to a secure system by an approved mechanism, so as to allow follow-up investigation by security staff.
	
	On Windows systems, deleting a file in File Explorer does not permanently delete a file - it sends it to the Recycle Bin instead. The Recycle Bin must be emptied, or alternative steps must be performed to remove files completely. Even then, in some cases the data may persist in disk, so data shredder tools may be needed to completely wipe a file. Thus, AV tools are recommended.'''

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Firmware behavior analysis provides protections by ensuring that installed firmware has not been tampered with or modified. Firmware analysis applies to mutable firmware and immutable read-only memory (ROMs).
	
	Firmware in deployed network devices is typically not analyzed and monitored for vulnerabilities and thus is subject to potential attacks. This technique makes use of known and measured behavioral attributes, including timing attributes, of analyzed firmware on deployed devices.
	
	A behavioral method that employs known timing measurements may use the timing results from a challenge and response protocol to detect the presence of malware in embedded firmware. Firmware device timing measurements are made, specific to the installed device, and are used in the verifying function.
	
	The original firmware image is modified by injecting a monitoring software component into the embedded firmware code. The injected software components will allow for a software root of trust, the challenge and response protocol, to be implement in the firmware.
	
	A challenge-response is issued and includes a nonce so that replays are not allowed. The firmware will calculate a checksum over all of memory, including the nonce, and return the result. The verification system will compare the computed checksum and the time it took for the computation of the checksum to determine if the firmware has been modified.
	
	## Considerations
	* The firmware code will need to be modified to include the behavioral monitoring functionality.
	* This technique is sensitive to the device the embedded firmware is hosted on and it is expected that the devices and firmware will need to be profiled and analyzed to determine timing estimation.
	* This technique is not expected to be one hundred percent correct as you would expect in a hardware root of trust solution and may require some tuning.'''

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Firmware in deployed network devices is typically not monitored for malicious changes. This technique provides a method to embed a software security component into the deployed firmware which provides a near real-time monitoring hook. The exception handling code, in the firmware, is typically used to expose any detected vulnerabilities.
	
	The injected software components provide a feature similar to intrusion detection systems for the firmware by detecting unauthorized modifications of the embedded firmware. The integrity of static code and firmware data are monitored continuously in the hosted devices. Comparisons are made to monitored elements like firmware memory addresses and data segments. Memory pages are scanned and if a modification is detected the software component may lock the page. This will protect subsequent attempted modifications to the firmware. The software component may utilize the exception handling code and thus be able to disclose the exact address of the modified memory.
	
	The injected software components are inserted during the firmware imaging process. The injected software is assumed to have knowledge of both the embedded code and the current execution state of the host program. The injected software will monitor and alert, in near real-time, on potential suspicious activity. The injected code is run alongside of the embedded code in the host. The injected software operates as an independent entity and is not dependent on the host software.
	
	Finally, this technique may implement other countermeasure techniques as part of their analytical processes. These should be identified by referencing other countermeasure techniques directly as necessary.
	
	## Considerations
	* The firmware code will need to be modified and re-hosted on the device.
	* Exposing monitoring hooks to the injected code may introduce additional risk.'''

	@definition "First-order logic is a collection of formal systems used in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects, and allows the use of sentences that contain variables."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	For propositions such as "Socrates is a man", one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man", where "there exists" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.
	
	The term "first-order" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted.
	
	## Considerations
	
	- Advantages:
	-- First-order logic is more expressive than propositional logic; one can talk about objects and their properties, relations between objects.
	-- First-order logic is able to make use of variables and quantifiers (e.g., "for all" and "exists".)
	-- First-order logic supports power forms of reasoning, such as inferring the properties of an unknown object from the properties of known objects.
	
	- Disadvantages:
	-- First-order logic is more difficult to learn and use than propositional logic, due to its greater complexity.
	-- First-order logic is also less tractable than propositional logic in many cases; reasoning about quantifiers and variables adds complexity.
	-- First-order logic can be difficult to apply in practice, due to the need to find appropriate axioms and rules for each application.
	
	### Verification Approach
	
	- Automated theorem provers can assist in formal verification, performing automated reasoning over system modeled in first-order logic and explore a complete space of system behaviors
	- First-order logic may be more expressive than necessary for many types of problems and may be more difficult to verify by SMEs.
	- Theorem provers based in FOL are capable of use in software verification tasks, but an SMT solver such as Z3 might be more appropriate.
	- Defining a set of competency questions (i.e., query use cases for a first-order logic ontology) can help scope the logic required for a complete solution.
	
	### Validation Approach
	
	- Domain SMEs should be identified to review the analytics results and compare them to expected results for a given input.
	- Where possible, an outside team of SMEs should inspect the formal logic specification of a system against its stated requirements and suitability to address its domain problem sets.
	- Defining a set of competency questions and the expected results provides one means of validation.

	@definition "Blocking a DNS lookup's answer's IP address value."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	This technique prevents a client from learning IP addresses deemed to be potentially malicious, which would have been delivered via forward resolution responses.
	
	Responses to forward resolution requests (that is, requests where a domain is sent and IP(s) are returned) are collected, and the IP address(es) included as a response are examined. If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the response is dropped and not forwarded to the client.
	
	The DNS lookup can be blocked by either dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server. To transparently prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values with addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8 or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted IP, only from learning about this IP address via a nameserver lookup request.
	* DNS Response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer IP address value(s).
	* DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.
	* Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.
	* This technique must be implemented logically between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.
	* DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as those using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the IP address(es) in the response.
	* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.'''

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Process isolation, in this context, is address space separation controlled by a security function that limits the communication between processes so that one process cannot directly modify the executing code of another process. For example with virtual address space:
	
	* Process A address space is different from process B address space, which prevents process A from writing to process B
	
	Hardware process isolation is commonly implemented through Direct Memory Access (DMA) which collaborates with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), or Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). These hardware controls are deployed directly on processors to aid hosts or enclaves in process isolation.
	
	* DMA - Direct memory access allows memory access to occur independently of the program currently run by the microprocessor. DMA allows for I/O devices to directly read from and write to memory, or it can be used to efficiently copy blocks of memory. During DMA transfers, the microprocessor can execute an unrelated program.
	* MMU - A memory management unit acts as an access control and is responsible for performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The MMU allocates each process its own virtual memory space.
	* IOMMU - An input-output memory management unit is used to allocate each I/O device its own virtual address space to the underlying physical addresses. IOMMU allows devices that do not support long memory addresses to address the entire memory space.
	
	## Considerations
	* Private hosts may be vulnerable to DMA attack if they have a PCI or PCI Express port that connects attached devices directly to physical address space.

Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface."

	Software-based restriction uses agent software installed on a computer system. The agent software monitors all IO port system traffic. The agent software is configurable to limit the use of certain devices connected to IO ports. The restriction software can also be configured to limit the access to files and applications on external storage devices connected to IO ports.
	
	Hardware-based restriction can also be employed to limit access to IO ports. For example, a hardware USB filter device that is placed between the host system and the external devices can filter IO port connections based on configurable rules. When new devices are connected to the USB filter the type of device is determined. Using an allow list a connection determination is made for the device.
	
	Some implementations detect when a device is connected in order to authorize the connection against a list of approved devices, in some cases by device type. For example, if the device is determined to be a storage device, then the contained files and executables are examined to more accurately identify the device type.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	This technique is used to detect an attacker attempting to exploit and execute code on a target system's call stack using return-oriented programming (ROP). Modern processors that have the ability to maintain a list of the branching calls, e.g., Intel's Last Branch Recording (LBR), can be used to track and analyze indirect branching calls that are indicative of malicious activity.
	
	In order to reduce the number of indirect branch calls to analyze to a manageable set it is assumed that malicious ROP activity will involve the use of system calls.  The technique observes indirect branch calls that are part of paths that lead to system calls, all others are ignored. Branching calls chained together is often referred to as gadgets and gadgets are often used in ROP attacks. Indirect branch calls that involve a transfer from user-space to kernel-space are of interest for this technique.
	
	Identification of potential ROP exploit execution includes:
	
	- Inspecting the LBR when a system function call is made
	
	- The LBR is configured to return only instruction of interest (ret, indirect jmp, indirect calls)
	
	
	- Behavior is analyzed for
	- Ret instructions that appear to target areas not preceded by the call sites
	- Sequences of small code fragments that appear to be chained through the indirect branching calls (gadgets)
	
	
	- Of interest are returns that appear to not render control back after calls
	- Typical ret-call are paired
	- gadgets will appear to have ret followed by instruction of next instruction of the following gadget
	
	
	## Considerations
	
	* May be operating system dependent since specific system calls are used to scope branching behavoir
	* Processors need to support access to a Last Branch Recording list feature
	* The size of the LBR stack can limit the expected size of the analyzed execution stack

	Input Device Hardening techniques filter certain commands, or disable related operating system functionality.
	
	### Analytics
	
	All of these values can be analyzed and compared to a baseline:
	
	* Amount of input
	* Duration of a single input
	* Durations between inputs
	* Value of input
	
	Context can also include:
	
	* User which is logged in, to include attributes such as physical location of the user
	* Date and time
	* System which is processing the input
	* Source device of input, to include its properties (eg. manufacturer), configuration (eg. keyboard layout) and behavioral attributes of this device (eg. first use)
	* Source system of input (local or remote system)
	* Other hardware devices attached to the system
	
	
	### Actions
	
	Actions can include:
	
	* Disabling the source device
	* Sending an alert
	* Locking the current session (eg. system screen lock, or returning to an authentication screen in a web app) and requiring one or more methods of authentication to continue
	* Administratively disabling credentials for the account or the entire account -- the technique *Account Locking*
	
	
	### Examples
	A malicious input device sends many keystrokes with approximately the same delay between each.  This does not match the normal cadence of input, and the device is disabled.
	
	Input to type the session user's name takes abnormally longer for each keystroke.  The system is locked to the password prompt screen.
	
	A system receives key press events from two different devices -- one device sends keystrokes after the other has been idle for a long time.
	
	A system receives physical input in a user session, while that user has sent input from a device located out of the country in the past hour.
	
	Network traffic is suddenly routed through a new external device, and nearly the same volume of network traffic is subsequently sent out the previously existing interface.  The new external device is disabled, and an alert is raised to investigate the network configuration for a potential compromise.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	An example K-center Clustering problem is to mimimize the number of points in a set that are necessary so that a every other point in the set is within some fixed distance of those points.  For instance, given n cities with specified distances, one wants to build k warehouses in different cities and minimize the maximum distance of a city to a warehouse.
	
	## Considerations
	
	- **Scalability**: Exact solutions are NP-hard.  However, algorithms
	that have been proven effective and create no more than 2x the
	optimal set of clusters can run in O(kn) proportional to k*n where
	k is the minimum number of clusters and n is the number of data
	points being clustered.
	
	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Unsupervised Learning**:
	
	- **Number of Clusters**: The Gonzalez (Gon) algorithm guarantees
	creating no more than twice the optimal number of clusters,
	where the optimal number is the minimum number of clusters to
	minimize total distance between representative points in the
	clusters [1].
	
	- **Cluster Analysis**:
	
	- **Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index**: Given ground truth set
	of class labels for the data, the Rand Index is a measure of the
	similarity between two data clusterings. The Rand Index is the
	accuracy of determining if a link belongs within a cluster or
	not. A form of the Rand Index may be defined that is adjusted
	for the chance grouping of elements, this is the Adjusted Rand
	Index [5].
	
	- **Adjusted Mutual Information**: Given ground truth set of class
	labels for the data, Adjusted Mutual Information corrects the
	effect of agreement solely due to chance between clusterings,
	similar to the way the Adjusted Rand Index corrects the Rand
	Index [6].
	
	- **Connection-based Clustering**:
	
	- **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
	
	- **Sensitivity**: Connection-based method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.
	
	- **K-center Clustering**:
	
	- **Silhouette Score**: The silhouette score refers to a scoring
	method that helps validate the consistency between clusters of
	data. The evaluation technique also produces a concise graphical
	representation of how well each object appear to have been
	classified.  It is suited to K-centric Clustering in that it also
	works for different metric spaces.
	
	- **Distance Metric**: The distance measure must be a true metric (see
	[2]).  Differences in the metric chosen may (e.g., Euclidean,a
	Manhattan) affect results significantly.
	
	- **Sensitivity**: Greedy implementations may be sensitive to
	outliers.

	@definition "The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point."
	@kb-article '''## **How it works**
	The goal of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is to identify the nearest neighbors of a given query point, so that we can assign a class label to that point. To determine which data points are closest to a given query point, the distance between the query point and the other data points will need to be calculated. The distance measures used can vary depending on the data set or implementation and help inform decision boundaries, which query points into different regions. Then, by defining the k-value (the number of neighbors to be checked to determine the classification of a specific query point), the data can be assigned its class label.
	
	For classification problems, a class label is assigned on the basis of a majority vote—i.e. the label that is most frequently represented around a given data point is used (the term “majority vote” is commonly used in literature, however, the technique is more technically considered “plurality voting”).  Regression problems use a similar concept as classification problem, but in this case, the average the k nearest neighbors is taken to make a prediction about a classification. The main distinction here is that classification is used for discrete values, whereas regression is used with continuous ones.
	
	Unlike other algorithms that explicitly model the problem, such as linear regression, KNN is instance-based. It means that the algorithm doesn't explicitly learn a model. Instead, it memorizes the training instances and uses them as "knowledge" for the prediction phase. It's also worth noting that the KNN algorithm is also part of a family of “lazy learning” models, meaning that it only stores a training dataset versus undergoing a training stage.
	
	## **Considerations**
	
	* **Scaling:** Scaling is a problem as KNN is a lazy algorithm and takes up more memory and storage compared to other classification methods.
	
	* **Implementation and Hyperparameters:** As KNN only requires a k-value and a distance metric, it is often an easy implementation and can adjust will to new training data.
	
	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Supervised Learning:**
	
	- **Cross Validation:** As cross validation methods like k-fold, leave-one-out, and stratified cross validation can help validate model performance. However, nuances like pessimism bias in k-fold cross validation or high variability in leave-one-out cross validation may need consideration.
	
	- **Classification:**
	
	- **ROC Curve:**  A standard technique used to summarize classifier performance over a range of tradeoffs between true and false positives is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
	
	- **Data Imbalance:** Imbalanced data sets where one class significantly outnumbers others, under sampling techniques like SMOTE may be beneficial in sampling minority classes.
	
	- **K-Nearest Neighbor**
	
	- **Choice of K:** The number of neighbors, K, affects the decision boundary. A smaller K can lead to a noisy decision boundary, while a large K can smooth it out, but may also blur class distinctions.
	
	- **K-d Tree:** Exact searching on large datasets can be computationally costly and inefficient. Implementing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like the K-d tree algorithm.
	
	- **Dimensionality:** KNN does not perform well while using high-dimensional data and can be sensitive to irrelevant features which can lead to overfitting.
	
	- **Distance Metric:** Choosing the appropriate distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, MinKowski, Hamming etc.) is essential, based on the nature of the data.

LKMs are typically used to add support for new hardware (as device drivers) and/or filesystems, or for adding system calls. When the functionality provided by a LKM is no longer required, it can be unloaded in order to free memory and other resources.
	
	Most current Unix-like systems and Microsoft Windows support loadable kernel modules, although they might use a different name for them, such as kernel loadable module (kld) in FreeBSD, kernel extension (kext) in macOS,[1] kernel extension module in AIX, kernel-mode driver in Windows NT[2] and downloadable kernel module (DKM) in VxWorks.

	@definition "Statistical regression method used for predictive analysis by modeling the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Takes independent variables (i.e. covariate, features, predictors, input variables) and dependent variables (i.e. response, output, “thing to be estimated”) and produces the coefficient(s) and intercept for a linear equation (e.g. (β1, β0) for y = β1x + β0) which predicts the relationship between the independent and independent variables by minimizing a cost function, Mean Squared Error, either directly in the case of univariate linear regression or by gradient descent* in the case of multivariate linear regression.
	
	## Considerations
	- There are four principal assumptions required for good results using linear regression (the first letters of the four principal assumptions form the "LINE" mnemonic):
	- Linearity and Additivity
	- Independent Residuals
	- Normal Residual Distributions
	- Equal Variances (i.e. homoscedasticity)
	- Linear regression is a low variance/high bias model.
	- Optimizers like Adam, Batch, and Mini-Batch and others are available for certain applications and data sets.
	- A large learning ratio or training coefficient may lead to divergent behavior of the model and too small of values may lead to long run times and inefficiency.
	
	
	## Verification Approach
	- Models are often evaluated by examining one or more of the metrics of R2, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
	- While there is no generally accepted single best performance metric as a criterion, users of linear regression should consider the suitability of one or more of these metrics for assessing the performance of their model.
	- Use well known data sets to verify model execution.
	
	## Validation Approach
	- Violating the principal assumptions of linear regression results in poor or misleading results.
	- Ensure data is truly representative and if there are any known biases.

	## Key Test Considerations
	
	- **Performance (Accuracy)** Identify instances in data where rule is expected to be triggered. Implement traceability and metrics for individual rule performance. Traceability of cases could be implemented as unit tests or as part of a fine-grained classification performance platform. For simple rule-based matching systems with many rules, individual rules may be unused or may create unusually high false positives (or false negatives relative to expectation.

	@definition "Controlling access to local computer system resources with kernel-level capabilities."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Mandatory access control is a non-discretionary access control system because the rules and polices that determine access is determined by a security control authority and not distributed to local users. Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.
	
	Access is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.
	
	### Common MAC implementations
	#### Security label access control
	A fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of MAC requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.
	
	Access controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.
	
	A security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.
	
	This type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of MAC is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.
	
	#### File path level controls
	A less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.
	
	This type of MAC is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative MAC method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.
	
	
	## Considerations
	Some implementations of security label mandatory access control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.
	
	Initial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.
	
	## Implementations
	
	* Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor
	* Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	### Digital Signature
	Digital signatures are used to verifying a message is from the expected sender. In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.
	
	### Message Authentication Code (MAC)
	MAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.
	
	## Considerations
	- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation. The CA verifies the owner of a public key and puts the sender's identity and public key into a certificate that is signed by the CA.
	- Digital signatures provide non-repudiation where a third party can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's digital certificate signed by the CA.
	- Symmetric keys must be exchanged securely via a private channel and management of new symmetric keys are needed for each pair of participants wishing to exchange messages.'''

Standards that can be used to implement message encryption include S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PGP.
	### Symmetric Cryptography
	Symmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key by both the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the cryptographic key with the recipient.
	
	## Considerations
	- Separate configuration settings to enable message encryption are often needed for each messenger client (e.g. webmail, desktop client, mobile).

The transition probability distribution (or transition model) and the reward function are often collectively called the "model" of the environment (or MDP), hence the name "model-free". A model-free RL algorithm can be thought of as an "explicit" trial-and-error algorithm. An example of a model-free algorithm is Q-learning.'

	@definition 'A modem -- a portmanteau of "modulator-demodulator" -- is a hardware device that converts data into a format suitable for a transmission medium so that it can be transmitted from one computer to another (historically along telephone wires). A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.'

	Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.
	
	The OWL languages are characterized by formal semantics. They are built upon the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) standard for objects called the Resource Description Framework (RDF). OWL classes correspond to description logic (DL) _concepts_.  OWL properties to DL _roles_, and individuals are named the same way in OWL and other DLs.

	When a user initiates authentication, they are asked for a one-time password, often in addition to other credentials such as a traditional password or smart card. The one-time password may be from a list provided in advance, sent via a channel such as SMS or HTTPS to an app, or a generated token.
	
	In the case of a physical token which generates one-time passwords incrementally based on time elapsed, that token device need not be connected to the internet. In different implementations, an administrator of the system, or a user with additional verification, can adjust for clock skew between the token and the verification system as needed.

	Outbound traffic, in this context, is network traffic originating from a private host or enclave destined towards untrusted networks.
	For example:
	
	* An enterprise desktop intranet user connecting to www.example.com
	* An internal mail server connecting to an external mail server, mail.example.com
	
	Filtering is commonly implemented as firewall rulesets to limit outbound traffic permitted to egress a host or network. Firewalls are deployed either directly on hosts through kernel level software implementations or installed in-line directly on network links. There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.
	
	There are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:
	
	* Block everything by default
	* Limit destination hosts
	* Limit destination transport or application protocols
	* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)
	
	## Considerations
	* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.
	* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.
	* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.

The device stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears to the operating system as a distinct "logical" storage device that uses part of the actual device. System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. Partitioning allows the use of different filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier.

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Certificates are analyzed outside of a TLS server connection using third-party secure update logs, domain name analysis and analytics.
	
	### Secure update certificate logs
	* Certificate Logs
	The key enabling feature is a secure service that maintains record logs of certificate activities. The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.
	
	The logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.
	
	* Certificate Monitoring
	Certificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.
	
	* Certificate Auditors
	Log integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.
	
	### Phishing domain name analysis
	* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.
	
	* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.
	
	* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.
	
	## Considerations
	* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.
	* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.
	* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.
	* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates
	* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring
	* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered'''

	@definition "Comparing the cryptographic hash or derivative of a pointer's value to an expected value."
	@kb-article '''## How It Works
	
	Pointer Authentication (frequently referred to as PAC, although the technique is properly Pointer Authentication) is a security feature to provide protection against attackers with memory read/write access.  A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.
	
	Although pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.
	
	The ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.
	
	## Considerations
	
	In the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.
	
	
	A known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.'''

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	A process code segment is an executable portion of computer memory allocated to a particular process. Process Code Segment Verification implements verification to compare a process code segment to some expected value.
	
	### Verification logic
	Verification can occur during application startup, or continuously during execution. The logic which verifies the process code may be separate in a third-party process, embedded in the application itself at compile time, or dynamically linked at runtime.
	
	### System of record
	Examples of systems of record:
	
	* On-disk application binary files or checksums
	* Remotely stored binary data or checksums
	* Embedded binary data or checksums
	
	### Post Verification Actions
	If the verification function determines a process code segment may have been altered, a capability may invoke Eviction techniques  as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to prevent the executable from launching in the future.
	
	## Considerations
	
	### False positives
	
	False positives commonly occur in the case that the layout of code in the process segment is legitimately modified:
	
	*  Operating system features or third-party security software may modify the layout of process code, for example in the defensive technique **Segment Address Offset Randomization**, or in the case that a module is rebased.  In both of these cases, the alteration occurs before the code is fully loaded into memory, and it would be possible to avoid the false positive by securely feeding this constant offset and any relocation data into the verification logic.
	
	* Process code segments may be written to modify themselves or other process code segments; however, this goes against widely-accepted current practices in software development.
	
	### False negatives
	
	False negatives can occur via alteration of the verification logic or source of truth, or insufficient verification logic.
	
	* Verification techniques which are executed only locally may be defeated by altering the local verification logic.
	
	* Verification that is run only on a recurring basis could be evaded if the malicious alteration is completed before verification is run.
	
	* Verification that requests an operation to be performed on a subset of the code segment could be evaded by performing that operation on a copy of the relevant bytes of the code segment.
	
	* Verification based on a system of record that can be altered may fail if that system of record is modifiable by a malicious user.'''

	Process tree analysis techniques gather information on how a process was initiated to determine if a process is malicious. For example, if a process was not initiated from boot or not initiated by another process, that process is identified as suspicious. Also, if a new process was started before a process initiated by the device (ex. during boot) and that new process was not initiated by a user (which can be determined by examining process parameters such as type of process, its creator, source, etc.) the process is identified as suspicious.
	
	For example, Microsoft Word may block execution of any subprocess that is not in an approved path.
	
	## Considerations

	@definition "Preventing execution of any address in a memory region other than the code segment."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	During execution of a process, the instruction pointer register should only point to addresses in a code segment (also called the .text segment), as this is the sole segment which should contain program code.
	
	When this technique detects an attempt to execute something that has been designated as non-executable, other techniques such as those in **Process Eviction** might be invoked, such as **Process Termination** to end the current process, or **Executable Blacklisting** to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.
	
	### Software-based implementations
	The software-based implementation in Windows XP SP2 might not check that every time the instruction pointer is changed, and does not check on each jump or return.  Before calling an exception handler, Windows XP SP2 software-enforced DEP checks whether the exception handler is located in a memory region marked as executable.  If the program was also built with SafeSEH, this implementation also checks before changing control to the exception handler whether it is a registered exception handler in the program's file on disk.
	
	### Hardware-based implementations
	The NX (No Execute) or XD (Execute Disable) bit on the processor specifies whether a certain part of memory is executable.  Early implementations set this bit by the memory segment, while modern implementations which are built on the flat memory model often store this bit in each entry of the page table, to control execution by the page.
	
	
	## Considerations
	
	Non-hardware process data segment execution prevention is more susceptible to being able to be turned off for a page of memory.
	
	Different implementations of this defense have been in place since the 1980s, but implementation stalled when larger 16-bit programs began stuffing code in the segments usually reserved for data. Many modern programs follow the best practice of separation of code and data, are able to run under this defense.
	
	ROP or ret2libc/return-to-function attacks could bypass this defense, as although they may pass attacker-controlled data or stack frames to a function, they abuse functions that are legitimately located in the .text segment (code segment) of the program.  For those, more advanced defenses such as a table of valid jump addresses, function call analysis, or return depth analysis could be used.'''

	- Attackers could have legitimately compromised any of the process properties, such as the user, to make the execution appear legitimate.
	- Location: If the full image path is not checked, there could be a conflict with an executable that appears earlier due to resolution involving the system environment path/classpath variable.
	- Parsing issues: If the raw command from a shell is analyzed, rather than the actual function call, it is important to identify the actual command  being run from its arguments.

	### Proprietary technology
	Security software might use proprietary technology to terminate processes, instead of the system-provided functions.    Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.
	
	### System-provided functions
	
	#### Windows tools
	In Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.
	
	The `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.
	
	In some cases, existing drivers can also be leveraged to kill processes.
	
	#### Unix/Linux tools
	In Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.
	
	The related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.
	
	## Considerations
	
	### Persistence Mechanisms
	Terminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.
	
	### Terminating Multiple Processes
	On most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.
	
	### Process Access Permissions
	Users must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.
	
	### Process Resource Handles
	
	#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles
	
	Processes may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.
	
	#### Signal Traps
	As the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.
	On Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.
	On Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.
	
	Therefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.
	
	##### Avoiding Signal Traps
	
	On Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.
	
	#### Hang on System Call Execution
	
	Even still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.
	Any malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.
	
	A process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.
	
	To speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.
	
	On Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.
	
	
	#### Kernel Processes and Threads
	The kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.
	
	#### Other Code using the Process
	
	Terminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.
	
	On Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.
	
	#### Zombie process
	
	After a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.
	
	##### Windows
	In Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.
	
	##### Linux
	In Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.  If the parent terminates, historically the parent has been changed to pid 1; however, in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above, processes can set a different process as the subreaper using the `prctl()` system call.
	
	Zombie processes and hung processes could be resolved with a restart of the system.
	
	#### System restart
	Finally a system restart might be required to kill a process.
	Systems which are only accessible via a remote in-band connection may become inaccessible if a process termination operation that is necessary for reboot does not complete.
	
	### Subsystems
	Processes that are started in a subsystem might not be fully terminated if they are terminated using the command for that subsystem.  For example, in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), processes started and terminated via WSL calls such as with the `kill` command in Bash may still have an entry in the Windows process table.'''

	- **External review of regular expressions**: Regular expressions used in rules should be reviewed by a independent developer SME.  Regex testing and visualization tools may be used to aid this review.  Back-tests for failure modes identified during the review shoud be developed.

Nonstandard terminal sessions and abnormal behaviors are analyzed in this technique. Abnormal behavior detection includes analysis of user input patterns in the real-time session, keyboard output and packet inspection.
	
	### Network Traffic Inspection
	Network traffic from internal hosts is the main concern and focus for the traffic inspection. The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions. Only sessions originated inside of the network are considered for the inspection. Traffic inspection includes analysis to determine if a human is involved in the session exchanges. Time-based statistics are captured for each session being analyzed by the detection engine.
	
	### Algorithm Analysis Description
	Analysis algorithms look for patterns in the network traffic captured from the session data.  A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining). Some metrics used during inspection include the following.
	
	* Number of rapid-exchange instances
	* Time interval between packets
	* Fixed cadence of traffic
	* Rhythm and direction of the initiation of instances
	* Volume of data flowing from internal to external controlling host
	* Data transfer characteristics
	* Variability in length of silent periods

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	In reverse resolution requests, the client sends to a nameserver (such as a DNS server) a query of an IP address, to get a response of the associated domain name(s). This technique drops reverse lookup responses where a domain name matches an entry in the blacklist, either verbatim or as a wildcard subdomain of a higher-level domain on the list. Such domain names might be unwanted because Forward Domain Name Resolution requests to such a blacklisted domain might return an unwanted IP address.
	
	This technique is useful because relying solely on Forward Resolution Domain Blacklisting will miss instances where the domain in question is forward-resolved in a manner that is not inspected via a subsequent technique (as is likely the case if that resolution is performed with DoH (DNS over HTTPS) or DoT (DNS over TLS)). Additionally, note that responses to forward lookups of that domain are *not* necessarily equal to the original IP in the reverse lookup request, and that future lookups of a string based on this domain may even employ a less-common name resolution protocol, such as NBNS.
	
	The DNS response can either be blocked by dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or by modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server.  To prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values, either with names like "localhost." or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted domain or any IP addresses that it might resolve to, only from learning about this domain name via a nameserver lookup.
	* DNS response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer domain name value(s).
	* DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.
	* Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.
	* This technique must be deployed between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.
	* DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the domain name(s) in the response.
	* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.'''

	@definition "Randomizing the base (start) address of one or more segments of memory during the initialization of a process."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	Many application exploits rely on an attacker specifying a location in memory, which points to data or code used by the attacker.  If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.
	
	Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing."  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the ".reloc" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.
	(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.
	
	
	## Considerations
	
	As the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.
	Another bypass technique is known as an "egg hunt," whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.
	
	The program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a "trampoline" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.
	
	If an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.'''

	Shortcuts, which are supported by the graphical file browsers of some operating systems, may resemble symbolic links but differ in a number of important ways. One difference is what type of software is able to follow them:
	
	- Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.
	
	- Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.
	
	Another difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:
	
	- Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path prefix[clarification needed], but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).
	
	- Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.
	
	- Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.'''

	@definition "Stack canaries, named for their analogy to a canary in a coal mine, are used to detect a stack buffer overflow before execution of malicious code can occur. This method works by placing a small integer, the value of which is randomly chosen at program start, in memory just before the stack return pointer. Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten. This value is checked to make sure it has not changed before a routine uses the return pointer on the stack. This technique can greatly increase the difficulty of exploiting a stack buffer overflow because it forces the attacker to gain control of the instruction pointer by some non-traditional means such as corrupting other important variables on the stack."

	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	This defense must be applied at compile-time, or via a patch to the program binary.  Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.
	
	Stack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.
	
	The canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.
	
	On most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a "push" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.
	
	On some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.
	
	
	## Considerations
	
	There are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.
	
	### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked
	
	If the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.
	
	### Determining the canary value
	
	Determining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.
	
	### Changing the canary value
	
	A vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.'''

	A basic example of string searching is when the pattern and the searched text are arrays of elements of an alphabet (finite set) Σ.

	In practice, the method of feasible string-search algorithm may be affected by the string encoding. In particular, if a variable-width encoding is in use, then it may be slower to find the Nth character, perhaps requiring time proportional to N. This may significantly slow some search algorithms. One of many possible solutions is to search for the sequence of code units instead, but doing so may produce false matches unless the encoding is specifically designed to avoid it.

	@definition "Analyzing system calls to determine whether a process is exhibiting unauthorized behavior."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	
	System calls are APIs between a user application and the operating system [1].
	
	By analyzing a process's use of these APIs, it is, in some cases, possible to ascertain whether a program is exhibiting unauthorized behavior, including trying to escalate its privileges.
	
	### Gathering System Calls
	A common method to capture system calls is to use kernel APIs to hook [2] a process's system call invocations.
	
	The Linux system call `ptrace` tracks other system calls in a process and allows their alteration; this is made use of by GDB.  `strace` utilizes `ptrace` and will print to stdout each system call invoked. Other applications record this data in local or remote databases.
	
	The log entry for each system call, which may reference additional information such as the date and time, and the process tree for the process which made the system call, is relayed, in real time or post-facto, to an analysis module which consults a catalog or model to determine whether the distribution matches a known-good or known-bad pattern.
	
	
	### Analysis
	
	System calls are analyzed with a variety of methods. Some analytics look for specific sequences of instructions, others may apply statistical methods to identify abnormal behavior. Sequences of instructions can be abstracted into conceptually higher order user activities, for example:
	
	* An attacker executes many system calls in a short period of time, with several sequences which could be used to escalate privileges.
	* Getting the contents from a URL, writing to a new file, and then executing the same file.
	* A ransomware program which either uses a loop or creates many threads to: read a specified file, encrypt its contents, create an output file with a similar name to the original file, and delete the unencrypted original.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* Duplicative or extraneous system calls may be added to malware to defeat analytics.
	* Malware could replace API hooking instructions to allow system calls to be made without being monitored.
	* A model built from a training set of system calls and related data may not be updated fast enough to detect new threats.

	Attackers may manipulate system settings or services to disable system logging or monitoring of security tools and events. Firewall and antivirus services are popular targets for attackers. Disabling system logs will also allow an attacker's actions to go unnoticed. Analysis of logs, registries, and process monitoring help defenders locate signs of tampering. Two possible approaches are to monitor hardened system services or to monitor registry updates for modifications to security settings.'''

	* Data exchanges identified in the network mapping efforts usually indicate such dependencies, but may not be part of the intended design.
	* Architectural design artifacts and SMEs may need to be consulted to determine if dependencies are intended or otherwise essential.
	* System depedency mapping can identify internal dependencies of standard and pre-built systems that should be incorporated into a complete system dependency model.
	* System dependencies for critical systems--those supporting critical organizational activities--should be prioritized for supply chain risk analysis.
	* System dependencies should identify the integral components of a given named system and their structure to form a system.
	* System dependencies with a given system may be fixed by a particular product's configuration, and leveraging external knowledge bases about dependencies available (e.g., from package managers) is essential.'''

	## Considerations
	
	- If the attacker has achieved persistence techniques, this technique may not be effective
	- Compromised systems may not respond to remote commands to shutdown or reboot, requiring physical intervention.
	- Shutting down a system will usually result in the memory losing its state which can be useful in forensic activities so this should be considered when deciding to shutdown.

	@definition "Assuring the integrity of a platform by demonstrating that the boot process starts from a trusted combination of hardware and software and continues until the operating system has fully booted and applications are running.  Sometimes called Static Root of Trust Measurement (STRM)."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	During the boot process, the BIOS boot block (which with this defense enabled, is the Core Root of Trust for Measurement) measures boot components (firmware, ROM). The TPM hashes those measurements and stores the hashes in Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs).  Upon a subsequent boot, these hashes are provided to a verifier which compares the stored measurements to the new boot measurements. Integrity of the boot components is assured if they match.
	
	Attestation of the secure boot occurs when a verifying entity requests a Quote which is a concatenation of the requested PCR values, hashed and signed by the TPM's unique RSA key.  The TPM signature is trusted because the private key is stored securely in hardware and never leaves the TPM.
	
	## Considerations
	
	* The TPM does not perform the follow-on actions of acting on the PCR value information, it just provides the PCR stored information.
	* The current version of TPM is 2.0.; most existing implementations use TPM 1.2.

	@definition "Validating that server components of a messaging infrastructure are authorized to send a particular message."
	@kb-article '''## How it works
	Transfer Agent Authentication can be accomplished in different ways for depending on the protocol. In Email, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are used to validate sender domain ownership.
	
	### SPF
	SPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.
	### DKIM
	DKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.
	
	### DMARC
	DMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the "From" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.
	
	## Considerations
	- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.
	- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.
	- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.
	- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.
	- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.'''

	URLs may contain components, for example:
	
	* scheme
	* userinfo
	* host name
	* port
	* path
	* query
	* fragment
	
	These components are used as features in analysis algorithms.
	
	Contextual information about a URL such as where it is embedded (ex. emails, files, network protocols), header, path, location, and origin information, as well as information about the content returned from the URL request, may be incorporated into an analytic for URL analysis. For example, if a URL indicates a .pdf file but an executable is actually returned, the combination of these two pieces of information indicates suspicious activity.
	
	Additional techniques include:
	
	* Extracting features of a URL such as domain name length, ratio of consecutive consonants, percentage of digits in a domain, and number of vowels. Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.
	* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters. For example, for google.com, the probability of a 'g' occurring at the beginning of a word, the probability of an 'o' occurring after a "g, the probability of an o" occurring after a 'g' and "o, and so forth. A dictionary or a list of known good domains is used to determine probability. Probabilities are multiplied to develop a score for the URL.
	
	URL analysis may trigger follow-on analytics such as **File Analysis**

	* Fidelity of analysis technique at detecting brand new URLs versus analyzing URLs of established domains'''
